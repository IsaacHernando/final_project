# final_Project - Legendre Symbol Algorithm

This file contains an algorithm to compute the Legendre Symbol.

For a prime number `p` and an integer `a`, the Legendre symbol $\Bigl(\frac{a}{p}\Bigr)$ is $\begin{cases} 1, & \text{if }a \text{ is square mod }p \\ -1, & \text{if }a \text{ is not square mod }p \\ 0, & \text{if }p \text{ divides }a\end{cases}$



1. The topic of your project. State the relevant background, definitions, and theorems, using natural language. Add any necessary references.
2. The structure of the lean project itself. How is your code organized?
3. The main definitions you constructed and/or theorems you formalized, and where they can be found in your code.
4. Any other relevant information.
